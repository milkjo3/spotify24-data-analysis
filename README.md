### Overview
This jupyter notebook examines the performance of the top Spotify songs of 2024 across different platforms including Spotify, Youtube, Tiktok, etc.

### Purpose 
The main drive of this small project was to play around pandas dataframes, while cleaning and formatting the data to present it in a analytical manner. 

### Setup
The tool we are using to analyze the .csv data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024/data) 
is the pandas library in Python. We also ultilize jupyter notebooks to help partition our code, along with an easier way to display tables via matplotlib.
